          <h2 class="tm-page-title">What is hacking</h2>
          <p><p>Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose. Description: To better describe hacking, one needs to first understand hackers</p></p>

          <h2 class="tm-page-title">Who is Hacker?</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p>A hacker is a person, who breaks into a system or network without any authorization to destroy, steal sensitive data, or performs malicious attacks. Hacker is an intelligent individual with excellent computer skills, along with the ability to create and explore into the computer’s software and hardware. Usually a hacker would be a skilled engineer or programmer with enough knowledge to discover vulnerabilities in a target system. She/he is generally a subject expert and enjoys learning the details of various programming languages and computer systems. For some hackers, hacking is a hobby to see how many computers or networks they can compromise. Their intention can be either to gain knowledge or to poke around to do illegal things. Some do hacking with malicious intent behind their escapades, like stealing business data, credit card information, social security numbers, email passwords, etc</p>

          <h2 class="tm-page-title">Types of Hackers</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p>Hackers usually fall into one of the following categories, according to their activities</p>
          <h5 class="tm-page-subtitle">Black Hat Hackers</h5>  
          <p>Black hats are individuals who use their extraordinary computing skills for illegal or malicious purposes. This category of hacker is often involved with criminal activities. They are also known as crackers</p>
          <p></p>
          <h5 class="tm-page-subtitle">White Hat Hackers</h5>  
          <p>White hats or penetration testers are individuals who use their hacking skills for defensive purposes. These days, almost every organization has security analysts who are knowledgeable about hacking countermeasures, which can secure its network and information systems against malicious attacks. They have permission from the system owner.          </p>
          <p></p>
          <h5 class="tm-page-subtitle">Grey Hat Hackers</h5>  
          <p>Gray hats are the individuals who work both offensively and defensively at various times. Gray hats fall between white and black hats. Gray hats might help hackers in finding various vulnerabilities of a system or network and at the same time help vendors to improve products (software or hardware) by checking limitations and making them more secure.   </p>
          <p></p>
          <h5 class="tm-page-subtitle">Suicide Hackers</h5>  
          <p>Suicide hackers are individuals who aim to bring down critical infrastructure for a “cause” and are not worried about facing jail terms or any other kind of punishment. Suicide hackers are similar to suicide bombers, who sacrifice their life for an attack and are thus not concerned with the consequences of their actions.</p>
          <p></p>
          <h5 class="tm-page-subtitle">Script Kiddies</h5>  
          <p>Script kiddies are unskilled hackers who compromise systems by running scripts, tools, and software developed by real hackers. They usually focus on the quantity of attacks rather than the quality of the attacks that they initiate</p>
          <p></p>
          <h5 class="tm-page-subtitle">Cyber Terroriests</h5>  
          <p>Cyber terrorists are individuals with a wide range of skills, motivated by religious or political beliefs to create fear of large-scale disruption of computer networks</p>
          <p></p>
          <h5 class="tm-page-subtitle">State Sponsored Hackers</h5>  
          <p>State sponsored hackers are individuals employed by the government to penetrate and gain top-secret information and to damage information systems of other governments</p>
          <p></p>
          <h5 class="tm-page-subtitle">Hacktivist</h5>  
          <p>Hacktivism is when hackers break into government or corporate computer systems as an act of protest. Hacktivists use hacking to increase awareness of their social or political agendas, as well as themselves, in both the online and offline arenas. They are individuals who promote a political agenda by hacking, especially by defacing or disabling websites. Common hacktivist targets include government agencies, multinational corporations, or any other entity that they perceive as a threat. It remains a fact, however, that gaining unauthorized access is a crime, irrespective of their intentions.         </p>
